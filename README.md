# Furtheon Network

Furtheon Network is a modified Polygon Edge, a POS EVM-based network, designed to provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications.

## Key Features

1. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus**: The network utilizes a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, allowing validators to participate in the consensus process and earn rewards.
2. **Improved Scalability**: By leveraging the Polygon Edge technology, Furtheon Network aims to provide enhanced scalability, supporting higher transaction throughput and reduced latency compared to the Ethereum mainnet.
3. **Customizable Features**: Furtheon Network offers customizable features, enabling developers to tailor the network to their specific needs, such as adjusting gas prices, block times, and other parameters.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Furtheon Network, please follow these steps:

1. **Install the Furtheon Network Client**: Download and install the Furtheon Network client software, which is responsible for running a node on the network.
2. **Set up a Validator Node**: If you wish to participate in the network as a validator, you'll need to configure your node and stake the required amount of the network's native token.
3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Developers can use the Furtheon Network's Ethereum-compatible environment to deploy and run their smart contracts.
4. **Interact with the Network**: Users and developers can interact with the Furtheon Network through various tools and applications, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets.

## Polygon Edge-based Architecture

Furtheon Network is built on the Polygon Edge framework, which provides a robust and flexible platform for building custom blockchain networks. Polygon Edge is an open-source, modular blockchain infrastructure that allows developers to create and customize their own Ethereum-compatible networks.

You can find the original Polygon Edge repository here: [0xPolygon/polygon-edge](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge)

By building on Polygon Edge, Furtheon Network inherits the benefits of this technology, including:

- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Furtheon Network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to easily deploy and run their Ethereum-based applications on the network.
- **Customizable Features**: Furtheon Network offers customizable features, enabling developers to tailor the network to their specific needs, such as adjusting gas prices, block times, and other parameters.
- **Scalability**: Polygon Edge provides enhanced scalability, supporting higher transaction throughput and reduced latency compared to the Ethereum mainnet.
